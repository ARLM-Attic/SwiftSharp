# SwiftSharp

SwiftSharp is the [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift) .NET compiler.

## Status

I just finished typing in the 1,300 lines of Swift grammar from the book and am now starting to write the compiler.

In other words, it's not production ready yet.

## Project Structure

* `SwiftSharp` is the core parser and compiler code as a Shared Project.
* `SwiftSharp.Compiler` is the command line compiler.

# So, this is what you've been doing with your down time, huh?

Everyone needs a hobby.
