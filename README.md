# SwiftSharp

SwiftSharp is an open source [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift) compiler for .NET.

## Status

It's not production ready yet.

### August 31, 2014

I rewrote the parser in F# because Swift's grammar is a bit too hand-wavy for `jay`. The parser is way better this way.

### August 4, 2014

I just finished typing in the 1,300 lines of Swift grammar from the book and am now starting to write the compiler.


## Project Structure

* `SwiftSharp` is the core parser and compiler code.
* `SwiftSharp.Test` contains tests from the Swift Book.
